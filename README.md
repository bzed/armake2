Successor to [armake](https://github.com/KoffeinFlummi/armake) written in Rust for maintainability and memory safety, aiming to provide the same features except for the custom P3D binarization, which was never finished.

**Status:** PAA commands not implemented, some options not implemented, testing.

## Changes since armake

- New v3 signatures
- Signature verification
- Seperate `preprocess` command
- Seperate `pack` command for non-binarized PBOs instead of `build -p`
- Configs are now rapified via the `rapify` command
- Improved config parser errors
- Automatic warning truncation to prevent spam

### Performance

Performance should be equal or better than `armake` depending on modification makeup and environment. More is done in-memory, reducing disk I/O at the expense of memory usage. Especially during binarization, less copies are performed, resulting in much faster builds for asset-heavy modifications or users without SSDs.

## Building

The build requires `cargo`, Rust's package manager and the OpenSSL development libraries.
To compile and run, use:

```
cargo run
```

To build a release, use:

```
cargo build --release
```

In order to build, you'll need to have OpenSSL installed on your system.

On **Linux**, the easiest way is to install OpenSSL via your system's package manager (if it is not installed already). Make sure you also have the development packages of OpenSSL installed. For example, `libssl-dev` on Ubuntu or `openssl-devel` on Fedora.

On **Windows**, the easiest way to get compilation and static linking of OpenSSL to work is to download [pre-compiled OpenSSL binaries](http://slproweb.com/products/Win32OpenSSL.html) (non-light, 64-bit) and set the following environment variables:

- `OPENSSL_DIR=C:\OpenSSL-WIN64`
- `OPENSSL_STATIC=1`
- `OPENSSL_LIBS=libssl_static:libcrypto_static`

## Testing

Unit tests:

```
cargo test
```

The end-to-end DayZ test harness builds a small test mod, binarizes it, packs
it into a PBO, signs it, and boots a local DayZ server (Steam app 223350, plus
app 1042420 with `--both`) to prove the mod loads and runs:

```
testharness/run.sh --both
```

See [testharness/README.md](testharness/README.md) for details.

## Binarizing models on Linux

BI's `binarize.exe` only runs on Windows, so on Linux `build` copies `.p3d`/`.rtm` files as-is (with the `non-windows-binarization` warning). With `--proton-binarize` (and for `armake2 binarize`) armake2 runs the DayZ Tools `binarize.exe` under Proton instead. Config and rvmat rapification is unchanged.

Requirements: DayZ Tools (Steam app 830640) and any Proton installed through Steam.

- `STEAM_ROOT`: Steam directory. Default: first of `~/.steam/debian-installation`, `~/.steam/steam`, `~/.local/share/Steam` that has `steamapps/common`.
- `DAYZ_TOOLS`: DayZ Tools directory. Default: `<steam>/steamapps/common/DayZ Tools` (uses `Bin/Binarize/binarize.exe`).
- `PROTON`: Proton directory (containing the `proton` script). Default: `Proton Hotfix`, `Proton - Experimental`, `Proton Experimental`, then any `Proton*` in `steamapps/common`.
- `BIOUTPUT=1`: show the output of Proton/binarize.exe.

armake2 builds a throw-away sandbox in the temp directory (a copy of `Binarize`, a fresh Wine prefix and the staged files) once per run and removes it at the end. Wine's default `Z:` drive maps to `/`, and `binarize.exe` walks directory trees from the drive root, so it would run for minutes on a real home directory; the sandbox therefore points `Z:` at itself. The first model of a run is slow because the Wine prefix has to be created (up to a few minutes on a cold start). Nothing in the Steam installation is modified. Models that reference textures or materials by absolute path may need a `P:` drive, which is not set up.
